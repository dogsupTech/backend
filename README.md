# Backend

This repository contains the backend services for DogsupTech, specifically serving as the backend for [Vetz.ai](https://vetz.ai). It is built using Flask and integrates with the Falcon 180B through Langchain for advanced language processing capabilities. Additionally, it integrates with Whisper for transcribing audio files.

The backend is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), with infrastructure set up using Terraform, and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) managed through GitHub Actions. The corresponding frontend for this project can be found at [dogsupTech/frontend](https://github.com/dogsupTech/frontend).

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes several API endpoints. The main routes are defined in `routes/api.py`.

- `/api/v1/example`: An example endpoint.
- More routes and their details can be found in the `routes` directory.

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Below are the required variables:

.env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=True
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
AI71_API_KEY=your_ai71_api_key
